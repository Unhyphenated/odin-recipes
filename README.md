# odin-recipes
This is my first project whilst doing The Odin Project. It's nice to be back into programming a bit. I think I've found a new perspective which is to simply do first, figure out all the details later. Just starting something has allowed me to learn a seemingly infinitely more number of things than I was able to in the past. For that, I am somewhat grateful.
